# multi-agent-games

Sandbox for multi-agent game-theory experiments with LLM agents: when do models help others at a
cost to themselves, defect, or collude?

@~/.claude/personal-repo-rules.md

`AGENTS.md` at the repo root is a symlink to `CLAUDE.md` so Codex/other agents see the same
instructions. Do not replace it with a separate file.

## Stack

- Python: `uv` for deps/venv, `ruff` for lint + format (line length 140), `ty` for types. Run
  `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . && uv run ty check` before shipping.
- Markdown: Prettier, 100 cols, `proseWrap: always`. Prettier is Markdown-only here.
- Tests: none until this repo is roughly > 50k LOC. Verify by running the code, not by adding a
  test suite. If a test would genuinely save time, ask first.
- Secrets/machine-specific env go in `.envrc.local` (gitignored), never `.envrc`.

## Docs

Durable lessons about this repo go in git:

- **One-line rules** → this file (`CLAUDE.md`), or `CLAUDE.local.md` for machine-specific
  (gitignored).
- **Longer reference docs** (5–300 lines) → `docs/*.md`, with a one-line index entry below.
- **Local-only docs** (not in git) → `docs/local/*.md`.

See `~/.claude/personal-repo-rules.md` (imported above) for the full convention.

Current docs:

- [Research questions — read before designing any experiment](docs/research-questions.md) —
  Robbie's original motivating questions (prosociality, in-group bias, monitor collusion)
